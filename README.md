# Converter for converting RGB color values to Hexadecimal values
## Just created this for myself. I didn't feel the online converters were that user-friendly

#### Using this to quickly convert from RGB to HEX when creating and styling webpages

## Usage

##### There are many ways to run this application
##### I like simply typing dotnet run in the console and inserting the RGB values. Something like dotnet run, and when asked for input, type rgb(255, 255, 255).
##### It's important that the above format is used. It may or may not run correctly, if the format of the RGB value deviates in any way from the format above.

Note that I am not creating a develop branch, since I do not intend to develop the application further. That may change in the future, and then I'll add more branches.
